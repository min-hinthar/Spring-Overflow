# Spring-Overflow
Spring Overflow is a community-centered platform/web app that combines web development and social justice, allowing users to ask and answer questions about web development, coding and programming, while supporting the Burma Spring Revolution and Civil Disobedience Movement.

## Overview
This web app is built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, WebSocket, Docker, and AWS. It has a gamification system that rewards users with reputation points and privileges for their contributions. It also supports the Burma Spring Revolution and Civil Disobedience Movement, a nonviolent resistance movement that opposes the military coup in Myanmar. You can create and share questions and answers that raise awareness and solidarity for the cause. You can also donate to verified organizations and individuals who are fighting for democracy and human rights in Myanmar.

## Features

Spring Overflow has the following features and functionalities:

- Users can sign up and log in with their email and password, or use their Google or GitHub accounts for authentication.
- Users can post questions and answers about web development, using a rich text editor that supports markdown, code formatting, and image uploading.
- Users can vote, comment, accept answers, edit, and delete their own questions and answers, as well as flag inappropriate or duplicate content.
- Users can earn reputation points and badges for their contributions, and unlock privileges such as editing other’s posts, closing and reopening questions, and accessing moderator tools.

## Tech-Stacks

Spring Overflow is built using the following cutting-edge technologies:

- [NEXT.js 14]:  React-based web development framework that offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities encompassing pre-rendering, server-side rendering, static site generation, and beyond.
- [Spring Boot]: A backend framework that provides a fast and easy way to create stand-alone, production-grade applications with various features.
- [Thymeleaf]: A template engine that integrates well with Spring Boot and allows me to create HTML views with natural and expressive syntax.
- [MySQL]: A reliable and widely used open-source relational database management system that stores the data of the web app.
- [Elasticsearch]: A powerful and scalable distributed system that enables fast and relevant search functionality.
- [Redis]: An in-memory data structure store that supports various data types and operations. It improves the performance and scalability of the web app, and enables the pub/sub messaging pattern.
- [RabbitMQ]: A robust and popular open-source message broker that supports multiple messaging protocols and patterns. It decouples the web app components and ensures the reliability and durability of the messages.
- [WebSocket]: A full-duplex and bidirectional communication channel between the client and the server. It allows the web app to push the latest data to the users, without requiring them to refresh the page.
- [Docker]: A software that enables the creation and deployment of applications using containers. It packages the web app and its dependencies into isolated and lightweight containers, which can run on any environment and platform.
